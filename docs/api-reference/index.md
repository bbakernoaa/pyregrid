# API Reference

This section provides a detailed reference of the `pyregrid` library's API.

The `pyregrid` library is organized into several modules, each responsible for specific functionalities:

- **pyregrid**: Main package with core regridding functionality
- **pyregrid.core**: Core classes like GridRegridder and PointInterpolator
- **pyregrid.interpolation**: Interpolation algorithms and methods
- **pyregrid.algorithms**: Specific interpolation algorithms
- **pyregrid.crs**: Coordinate reference system management
- **pyregrid.utils**: Utility functions and helpers
- **pyregrid.accessors**: Xarray accessor extensions
- **pyregrid.dask**: Dask integration and parallel processing
- **pyregrid.scattered_interpolation**: Methods for interpolating scattered data
- **pyregrid.point_interpolator**: Point-to-grid interpolation functionality
