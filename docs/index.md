# PyRegrid Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for PyRegrid, a powerful Python library for regridding geospatial data with a focus on climate and meteorological applications.

## Overview

PyRegrid is designed to efficiently regrid data between different coordinate systems and grid structures. It provides:

- Multiple interpolation algorithms (bilinear, nearest neighbor, conservative, etc.)
- Support for xarray and dask for scalable computations
- Integration with common geospatial libraries
- High-performance regridding capabilities for large datasets

## Key Features

- **Xarray Integration**: Native support for xarray DataArrays and Datasets
- **Dask Support**: Parallel processing capabilities for large datasets
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Various interpolation methods for different use cases
- **Coordinate System Handling**: Robust management of different coordinate reference systems
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for handling large geospatial datasets

## Getting Started
